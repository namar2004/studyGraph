#Python Version:

##Dependencies:

* nodebox
* networkx

##Errors:

* _KeyError: 'panel'_ This could have happened because you used pip to install nodebox.  Go to https://github.com/nodebox/nodebox-opengl and download that folder.  Copy the theme folder from nodebox/gui into your own /Users/<username>/anaconda/lib/python2.7/site-packages/nodebox/gui/, or wherever your nodebox is installed.
